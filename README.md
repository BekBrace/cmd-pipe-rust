# Rust TUI Application with Cursive

This repository contains a Rust project that demonstrates how to create a Text User Interface (TUI) application using the [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) library. The application runs an external command (`dir` for Windows) and displays the output in a dialog box within the terminal interface.

## Features
- **Text-based User Interface**: Built using the Cursive library for a clean, interactive terminal UI.
- **Command Execution**: Executes external commands and captures their output.
- **Command Output Display**: Outputs the result of the command in a TUI dialog box.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust installed on your system: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- A terminal environment (this example uses `cmd` for Windows).
- Cursive library version 0.21.1 [latest vesion till this date!]
